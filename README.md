The purpose of this program is the test the understand we've attained learning about regular expressions.

First, you will have to install pytest to make sure the test program can apply to the different programs that have been written. After you'll be able to run the test programs to make sure that the situations that have been set up pass.

These tests are split into testing separation by regex, extracting by regex, and validating that words and numbers are defined correctly.
